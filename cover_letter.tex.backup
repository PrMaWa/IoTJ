Dear Editor,

all authors have checked this manuscript and have agreed to submit it to Journal of Biomedical Informatics, to be considered for publication.
This manuscript is the authors' original work and has not been published, nor has it been submitted simultaneously elsewhere.

The main contributions of this paper are:
the presentation of a new functionality of the tool IoT-EG \textit{(Internet of Things - Event Generator)}. IoT-TEG automatically 
generates a wide variety of events for the testing phases of any event-processing program. We have checked that the majority of IoT 
critical situations that want to be detected follow a specific pattern. The new IoT-TEG functionality allows to simulate the behaviour of 
different event attributes in order to generate test events following a specific pattern. One of that IoT critical situations 
to detect are the falls. We introduce an analysis of the major parameter involved in a fall, the acceleration. The acceleration can 
measure the movement of the body, so its behaviour is analysed in two types of falls. The used IoT system which detect the falls has
been improved, its hardware evolution as well as the obtained data is described and analysed. Finally, in order to detect the 
studied falls, event patterns of both fall types are defined.

We are convinced that the presented results are important contributions for researchers and practitioners.
Internet of Things (IoT) gained more and more attention recently, the IoT systems have to handle a huge amount 
of information which arrives as events. These events need to be processed in real time
to make correct decisions. We find strongly necessary to test the IoT systems which will process that information. 
To test IoT systems, and its functionalities, it is necessary to use a large amount 
of events with specific structures and values. The automatic event generation to test IoT systems had not yet been 
considered. Our IoT-EG system helps to automatically generate events in order to obtain a 
solid and reliable IoT system.


according to the improvements of the fall detection prototype. The main contributions of this paper are:

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{A new functionality of the IoT-TEG system} which allows to simulate the behaviour of 
 different event attributes in order to generate test events following a specific pattern.
 \item \textbf{An analysis of the major parameter in a fall}: while a person is falling, the acceleration 
 is the parameter that can measure the movement of the body. This parameter is analysed in order to know 
 its behaviour during two types of falls.
 \item \textbf{A study of the fall detection prototype evolution}: the system which is been used is
 continuously being improved. We describe the evolution of its architecture, how the data is analysed and 
 the detected problems.
 \item \textbf{New definitions of two types of falls}: after the analysis of the acceleration during two 
 types of falls a new definition for each one has been done. The obtained data of the fall detection 
 prototype is used to define EPL of EsperTech patterns to detect those type of falls. 
\end{itemize}


Thank you so much for receiving our manuscript and considering it for review.
We highly appreciate your time and look forward to your response.

Kind regards,

Lorena, Luigi, Matthias, and Inmaculada.
